(1) As used in these rules:  (a)   \"Cold process smoked fish\" means a smoked  fish  that  has  not  been subjected to sufficient heat to coagulate the protein throughout the fish.  (b)   \"Critical control point\" means a point, step, or procedure in a  food process at which control can be applied and,  as  a  result,  a  food  safety hazard can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.  (c)   \"Critical limit\" means the  maximum  or  minimum  value  to  which  a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a  critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to  an  acceptable  level  the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard.  (d)    \"Fish\"  means  all  freshwater  or  saltwater   finfish,   mollusks, crustaceans, and other aquatic organisms, other than birds or  mammals,  that are intended for human consumption.  (e)   \"Fish product\" means  any  article  of  food  or  any  other  article intended for, or capable of being used as, human  food  that  is  derived  or prepared, in whole or in part, from any portion of any fish.  (f)   \"Hazard analysis and critical control point  (HACCP)  plan\"  means  a food processing plan under which a food processing plant operator effectively prevents food safety hazards by monitoring food safety variables at  critical control points and by controlling the variables within critical limits.  (g)   \"Hot process smoked fish\" means a smoked fish that has been subjected to sufficient heat for a sufficient period of time to coagulate  the  protein throughout the fish.  (h)   \"Liquid smoke\" means an aqueous solution of  wood  smoke  that,  when suitably diluted, may be used to impart a smoke flavor.  (i)   \"Loin muscle\" means the longitudinal quarter  of  the  great  lateral muscle of the fish that is free  from  skin,  scales,  visible  blood  clots, bones, gills, and nonstriated parts.  (j)   \"Process authority\" means a person who has expert  knowledge  of  the commercial processing of fish and fishery products based on a combination  of education, training, and experience.   (k)  \"Reduced oxygen packaging\" means packaging that reduces the amount of oxygen in a package by mechanical evacuation of the  oxygen,  displacing  the oxygen with another gas or combination of gases, or otherwise controlling the oxygen content in a package to a level below the level of 21% normally  found in the surrounding atmosphere. \"Reduced oxygen  packaging\"  includes  altered atmosphere, modified atmosphere, controlled atmosphere, low oxygen and vacuum packaging.  (l)   \"Smoked fish\"  means  a  freshwater  or  saltwater  finfish  that  is prepared by treating it with salt (sodium chloride) and subjecting it to  the direct action of the smoke  from  burning  wood,  wood  sawdust,  or  similar burning material or from liquid smoke flavoring applied to the surface  in  a gaseous, liquid, or vaporized state with or without heat.  The term  includes products composed in whole or in part from  smoked  fish,  such  as  sausage, pate, or snack dip.  (m) \"Temperature-indicating device\" means an accurate, standard thermometer or equivalent device, such as a resistance temperature device or thermocouple.  (n) \"Temperature-recording device\"  means  a  device  that  is  capable  of providing a continuous record of the temperature conditions being monitored.  (o)   \"Water phase salt\" means the percentage of salt (sodium chloride)  in the  water  phase  of  the  finished  fish  product.   It  is  calculated  by multiplying the percentage of salt (sodium chloride) by 100 and dividing that number by the sm  of  the  percentage  of  salt  (sodium  chloride)  and  the percentage of moisture in the finished product.  Moisture  and  salt  content shall  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the  method  described  in   the publication entitled \"Official Methods of Analysis of   AOAC,  International\" 16th edition.  The publication is adopted in these rules by reference and may be obtained from AOAC, International, 2200 Wilson  Boulevard,  Suite  400-GG, Arlington, Virginia 22207-3301, at a cost as of the time of adoption of these rules of $359.00 (print version), or from the Department of Agriculture, Food Division, Ottawa Building, Fourth Floor, P.O. Box 30017, Lansing, MI 4 48909, at cost.  (2)   Terms defined in Act No. 39 of the Public Acts of 1968,  as  amended, being ยง289.701 et seq. of the Michigan Compiled Laws, have the same  meanings when used in these rules.
